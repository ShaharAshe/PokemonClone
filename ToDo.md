### 1.best solution, for the header problem, is to seprate the stack from StateMachine, need to create class called StateStack with all the methods,StateMachine has,and to send a Refrence to that Stack Object
### 2.need to fill playstate virtual functions, better to do after seperate stack and changing stuff
### 3.gridToPixelPosition is greyed, need to add it to playerclass,and change how we get it to the player
### 4.in general,need to implemnt playstate as the previous map,player etc...
### 5.Need to check if startstate is working,will need to debug
