# MiniMons - Pok√©mon Clone

## Overview

This project is our final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. We've created a Pok√©mon clone where players embark on a journey to defeat the Green Nightmare, a powerful Pok√©mon located on the fourth map. Players choose their starter Pok√©mon and train them to prepare for this ultimate challenge.

## Project Description
This is our attemp of creating a pokemon game engine. we can go through 4 different maps, battle different pokemons, 
level up our own starter.
We've integrated the Tiled application into our workflow. Tiled allows us to design and create maps with ease.
Once the maps are created, we use the [Tileson API](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/Tileson) to process the output and seamlessly integrate it into our game engine.
