# MiniMons - Pok√©mon Clone

## Overview

This project is our final project for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. We've created a Pok√©mon clone where players embark on a journey to defeat the Green Nightmare, a powerful Pok√©mon located on the fourth map. Players choose their starter Pok√©mon and train them to prepare for this ultimate challenge.
